# Tokyo
## Box Plot
The Box plot showed many outliers. This showed there were days when the amounts of NO, NO2, NOx and SO2 in the air  were really high due to some activities and festivals

## Line Graphs
The amounts of NOx, NO2 SO2 in the air kept flactuating, although they were days when they were much higher than usual that is on the 4th, 11th and 16th of March. Tracing back these days they aligned with some festivals which were were celebrated in Tokyo which are the Tokyo Marathon,  the Fire Walking Festival and the Tokyo Anime Award Festival.I would like to believe that this festivals had an effect on the high amount  of NOx, NO2 and SO2 in the air.git
