# Analysis of the Ogada Air Quality
## Box Plot
- The temperature is a normal distribution with no outliers. It shows that Ogada in Obubra has an even predicatable distribution of temperature conditions.
- PM10 and PM1 are right skewed. The data has a deviation of being a lot higher than the mean. Notwithstanding, there are no outliers.
- PM2.5 is also right skewed within a smaller than PM10 and PM1. Moreover, it shows the presence of outliers that fall beyond the three standard deviations of the bell curve.
- For PM1 and PM10 this shows that there was a sudden change in the size of ambient particles. A change that occured very rapidly. The change was both a coagulation and atomisation of the particles.

## Line Graphs
- For temperature considering that the box plot shows a normal distribution of data points and the line graph displays fluctuations up and down on a roughly balanced basis, it is evident that Ogada experiences balanced temperature conditions.
- For PM10 and PM1 their graphs are perfectly identical. They start with relatively low amounts of either then rapidly increase to very high levels. On the flip side, PM25 was high when PM1 and PM10 was low. And as PM1 and PM10 rapidly increased PM25 dropped to a near negligible amount. This leads to the possible narrative that the particles in the air were atomised and coagulated seemingly overnight.
- Moreover, for each of these particulate matter sizes they are above the allowable 24 hour amount most of the time. This leads to the deduction that the air quality in Ogada is really bad. It is one of the areas that United Nations is targetting to improve.
